                                                    around the room,” says Breining. But placing one in the wrong spot
                                                    can be almost as bad as not having one at all.</p>

                                                <p>Even living rooms with less than generous proportions usually require

                                                    windows, suggests Allen-Brett, to trick your eye into thinking the
                                                    room is taller. Most standard curtain panels measure 84 or 96
                                                    inches, allowing you to go about 3 inches above the window casing

                                                <h2>Give Old Finishes The Cinderella Treatment</h2>
                                                <p>Got dated fixtures? Reinvent them with spray paint and inexpensive
                                                    refinishing kits. “A 1980s brass chandelier can get a new lease on
                                                    life with a quick coat of hammered-bronze or satin-nickel spray
                                                    paint,” says Breining.</p>
                                                <p>Even outdated kitchen cabinets benefit from a few coats of white
                                                    paint and new hardware. And if you thought there was no hope for
                                                    Formica countertops, think again. Breining swears by Rust-Oleum
                                                    Countertop Transformations, a DIY counter-coating product that
                                                    mimics stone, making even the ugliest 1970s counter look fresh.</p>
                                                <p>What’s left to do: Swap out cracked and mismatched switch plates and
                                                    outlet covers for updated matching ones. Says Lynne: “Nothing drags
                                                    down a refreshed space like a dingy, almond-colored switch plate.”

                                                <p>“There are few things more ridiculous-looking than hanging dinky
                                                    little art too high on the wall,” says Breining. The middle of a
                                                    picture should hang at eye level. If one person is short and the
                                                    other tall, average their heights.</p>
                                                <p>Also take scale into account for a large wall, go big with one
                                                    oversize piece or group smaller pieces gallery-style. For the
                                                    latter, don’t space the pictures too far apart 2 to 4 inches between
                                                    items usually looks best.</p>

                                                    look bigger, but in reality, floating the furniture away from the
                                                    walls makes the room feel larger, she says.</p>

                                                <p>“Mirrors can make a space feel brighter because they bounce the light
                                                    around the room,” says Breining. But placing one in the wrong spot
                                                    can be almost as bad as not having one at all.</p>
                                                <p>Put mirrors on walls perpendicular to windows, not directly across
                                                    from them. Hanging a mirror directly opposite a window can actually
                                                    bounce the light right back out the window.</p>

                                                <p>Follow these basic rules for an area rug: “In a living room, all four
                                                    legs of the sofa and chairs in a furniture grouping should fit on it
                                                    the rug should define the seating area,” says Breining. “At the very

                                                    he adds.</p>
                                                <p>Even living rooms with less than generous proportions usually require
                                                    an 8-by-10-foot or a 9-by-12-foot rug to properly accommodate a

                                                    inches, allowing you to go about 3 inches above the window casing

                                                <p>Got dated fixtures? Reinvent them with spray paint and inexpensive
                                                    refinishing kits. “A 1980s brass chandelier can get a new lease on
                                                    life with a quick coat of hammered-bronze or satin-nickel spray
                                                    paint,” says Breining.</p>
                                                <p>Even outdated kitchen cabinets benefit from a few coats of white
                                                    paint and new hardware. And if you thought there was no hope for
                                                    Formica countertops, think again. Breining swears by Rust-Oleum
                                                    Countertop Transformations, a DIY counter-coating product that
                                                    mimics stone, making even the ugliest 1970s counter look fresh.</p>
                                                <p>What’s left to do: Swap out cracked and mismatched switch plates and
                                                    outlet covers for updated matching ones. Says Lynne: “Nothing drags
                                                    down a refreshed space like a dingy, almond-colored switch plate.”

                                                <p>“There are few things more ridiculous-looking than hanging dinky
                                                    little art too high on the wall,” says Breining. The middle of a
                                                    picture should hang at eye level. If one person is short and the
                                                    other tall, average their heights.</p>
                                                <p>Also take scale into account for a large wall, go big with one
                                                    oversize piece or group smaller pieces gallery-style. For the
                                                    latter, don’t space the pictures too far apart 2 to 4 inches between

                                                <p>Think of a nice hotel lobby: The furniture is arranged in groupings
                                                    that invite conversation. When you place the furniture in your

                                                    facing each other at each end of the coffee table, or an H-shape,

                                                <p>One common mistake to avoid: Pushing all the furniture against the
                                                    walls. People do that because they think it will make their room
                                                    look bigger, but in reality, floating the furniture away from the
                                                    walls makes the room feel larger, she says.</p>
